## Project Overview

This repository contains tools, scripts, and notebooks for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generating reports from sales datasets. The goal is to identify key patterns, trends, and actionable insights that can help businesses optimize their sales strategy.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Trend and seasonality analysis
- Data visualization using popular Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Generation of summary reports
- Extensible to various sales datasets

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bishtrohit1/Sales-Data-Analysis.git
   cd Sales-Data-Analysis
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Place your sales dataset (CSV format) in the `data/` directory.**
2. **Run the analysis scripts or Jupyter notebooks:**

   - Scripts:  
     ```bash
     python scripts/your_analysis_script.py
     ```
   - Jupyter Notebook:  
     Open and run the notebook in the `notebooks/` folder using Jupyter Lab or Notebook.

3. **Review output visualizations and reports in the `output/` or `reports/` directory.**
